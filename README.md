# TwoFactorX

Add a two-factor authentication to the MODX manager. Secure the front end login
with a pre-hook for the "Login" extra. Generate a QR Code for saving the
authenticator secret with a snippet in the frontend.

## Installation

MODX Package Management

## Usage

Install via package manager. After you have saved the two-factor secret shown in
the TwoFactorX tab when you edit your manager user, you can enable the system
setting twofactorx.enable_2fa. When the system setting enable_onetime is
enabled, a manager user can log in once without two-factor authentication.
